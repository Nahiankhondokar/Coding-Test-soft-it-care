This is an API based application where we can give payment to our employee which is called cashOut or we can receive some payments from other which is called cashIn. Aslo we are showing a balance sheet of our total payments.

We are taking some data from API like name, amount, payment_recevier, payment_type, description, date, time. we add this data to our MySql database. These payments we can edit, update & delete. We can receive payments & we can pay payments. Moreover, we manage a balance sheet from where we can check how much payments we received & we paid.
