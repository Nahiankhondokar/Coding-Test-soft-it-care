This is an API based application where we can give payment to our employee which is called cashOut or we can receive some payment from other which is called cashIn.

We are taking some data from API like name, amount, payment_recevier, payment_type, description, date, time. we add this data to our MySql database. These payments we can edit, update & delete. Moreover, we manage a balance sheet from where we can check how much payments we received & we paid.
